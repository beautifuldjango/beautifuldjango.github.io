# A new book for and from the Django community

"Beautiful Django" is inspired by ["_Beautiful Code_"](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596510046.do "O'Reilly Beautiful Code"), published by O'Reilly. In _Beautiful Code_, each chapter is written by a different person on the subject of their choice. The only (strong) constraint: to illustrate what they think constitutes "Beautiful Code".

This book inspired the idea of creating a "_Beautiful Django_" book along similar principles.

## Why _Beautiful Django_?

**To help the community** build on each others knowledge by sharing what is beautiful about Django and how it is used in the wild.

**To Promote Django** by illustrating Django's greatest aspects, from its vibrant community to its elegant inner workings.

**To raise money** by donating all royalties to the Django Software Foundation.

**To promote [diversity](/general/2016/10/15/diversity.html "Our diversity statement")** by highlighting different voices within the Django community.

## Content

As with "_Beautiful Code_", each chapter will be written by a different author, presenting a subject that they feel passionately about.

Example chapters might include:

- A short code example
- A presentation of a module or library
- A discussion of community-related events
- A personal story or achievement
- A comic strip (?)

We anticipate a handful of chapters exploring elegant code, alongside code-free chapters that are more introspective and inspirational in nature.

The objective is _not_ to develop a "how-to" or "technical best pratices" book; many great resources already exist for learning Django and we don't want to step on their toes.
Instead, we hope to introduce a new perspective on Django and its community.

## Design

To do justice to the book's content, we also want to develop a high quality aesthetic. That means including illustrations and great graphic design from the outset.

As with the book's content, we hope to source this directly from the Django community.

## Fundraising and publishing

Our objective is to raise money to allow us to pay the contributors and print the final book. For more information, see the [Funding](/book/2016/10/15/funding.html) and [Publishing](/book/2016/10/15/production.html) pages.

## Contributing

To make this book a reality, we need your help! As such, we are looking for contributors of all kinds.
If you think you can help, please see the [Contributing section](/general/2016/10/15/contributing.html).

Note that all contributors are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](/general/2015/12/31/code-of-conduct.html).


With much :heart:, Adrien Brunet and [contributors](/general/2016/10/15/contributors.html "List of our loved contributors").
