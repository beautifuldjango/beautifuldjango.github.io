# Diversity

Efforts made by the Django community to promote diversity are remarkable. This book will attempt to follow the same standards.

As such, special attention will be given to ensure everybody involved with the project will feel welcome, regardless of their origin, gender, country and anything else that makes them unique.

We hope we can work alongside special interest groups (e.g. Django Girls) to make that happen.


## Code of Conduct
