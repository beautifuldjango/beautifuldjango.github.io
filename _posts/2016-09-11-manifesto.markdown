# A new book for and from the Django community

"Beautiful Django" is inspired by ["Beautiful Code"](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596510046.do "O'Reilly Beautiful Code"), published by O'Reilly. Each chapter is written by a different person on the subject of their choice. The only (strong) constraint: to illustrate what they think "Beautiful Code" is. We can witness many different programming languages, various patterns, different frameworks, several application fields and heterogenous author backgrounds.

This book inspired me to create "Beautiful Django" with the same principles.

_The following sections are a work in progress. They will be updated on the go during the weeks to come. Each section is opened for further discussion, I'm all ears, please speak up._


Aim
---

This is not another introduction to Django, a lot of books address this matter and we won't try to step on their feet.

There are two main purposes for the book:

- Sharing: the idea is to spread the best Django use cases and show what is beautiful about it. It's a way to help everyone to stand on taller giant shoulders.
Each Chapter could be based on a short code example, a module/library presentation, some community related-events or even personal-achievements!
If we can expect a handful of chapters presenting bits of clever and elegant code, I also expect to find inspirational chapters without much code. If I love Django, it's mainly for its community. I have to admit the code is pretty excellent too, but both aspects should find a place in this book.


- Promote Django as a whole: All royalties from this book will be donated to Django Software Foundation. This book should illustrate all great aspects of Django, from its community to its deepest hidden pattern. A special attention will be drawn on diversity.


*Bonus*: 
Tech books can be cumbersome sometimes, a nice illustration or a good design really makes the difference. [2 Scoops of Django](https://www.twoscoopspress.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-8) illustrates that perfectly, the attention to details and carefully chosen illustrations make the book even better.
With the wide range of backgrounds in the Django community, I hope we could find someone able to illustrate a chapter only via a cartoon story or something similar (who said emoji?). Our community is bright enough to write a chapter in a funny new way. It would make the whole book more attractive.

*This draft has been elaborated from various discussions I had with Harry Percival, Daniel GreenFeld, Audrey Roy, Baptiste Mispelon, Nicole and Olivier Harris, Adrienne Lowe. This draft only engages myself. Words are mine and I'm not speaking for them.

*A _huge_ thank you to Ana Balica for reviewing my spelling... (I'm feeling ashamed now! They were so many mistakes!)
