# A new book for and from the Django community

The "Beautiful Django" book idea comes from the O'Reilly book ["Beautiful Code"](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596510046.do "O'Reilly Beautiful Code"): master classes in software design reunited in a book. Every chapter is written by a different person on the subject of their choice. The only (strong) constraint: illustrate what they think a "Beautiful Code" is. We can witness many different programming languages, various patterns, different frameworks, several application fields and heterogenous author backgrounds.

This book inspired me to create "Beautiful Django" with the same principles.

_The following sections are a work in progress. They will be updated on the go during the weeks to come. Each section is opened for further discussion, I'm all ears, please speak up._


Aim
---

This is not another introduction to Django, a lot of books address this matter and we won't try to step on their feet.

There are two main purposes for the book:

- Sharing: the idea is to spread the best Django use cases and show what is beautiful about it. It's a way to help everyone to stand on taller giant shoulders.
Each Chapter could be based on a short code example, a module/library presentation, some community related-events or even personal-achievements!
If we can expect a handful of chapters presenting bits of clever and elegant code, I also expect to find inspirational chapters without much code. If I love Django, it's mainly for its community. I have to admit the code is pretty excellent too, but both aspects should find a place in this book.


- Promote Django as a whole: All royalties from this book will be donated to Django Software Foundation. This book should illustrate all great aspects of Django, from its community to its deepest hidden pattern. A special attention will be drawn on diversity.


*Bonus*: 
Tech books can be cumbersome sometimes, a nice illustration or a good design really makes the difference. [2 Scoops of Django](https://www.twoscoopspress.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-8) illustrates that perfectly, the attention to details and carefully chosen illustrations make the book even better.
With the wide range of backgrounds in the Django community, I hope we could find someone able to illustrate a chapter only via a cartoon story or something similar (who said emoji?). Our community is bright enough to write a chapter in a funny new way. It would make the whole book more attractive.

Diversity
---------

I think what impress me most in our community are the efforts done to ensure and respect diversity.
That's why special attention will be brought to ensure diversity in gender, countries represented, fields application and authors backgrounds. I hope we can represent all minorities within this book, there are no reasons we couldn't.
I hope we can work together with every dedicated community (e.g. Djangogirls) to make that happen.


Who can contribute?
-------------------

Everyone! ["EVERYONE"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrTsuvykUZk "The Professional -- Everyone")!

But as stated in the diversity part, the idea would be to represent our entire world. We shouldn't publish this book unless every continent and a reasonable ratio of different people are represented. It is not a blog posts best-of exclusively written by scientific stars.
I'm also considering for now to offer anonymous contribution but I don't know if anyone would like to contribute without taking credits for it. Feedback people?

If you want to contribute, there is not only the writing part but also design, reviews, promotions etc... Any help, even the smallest comment on that manifesto draft is greatly appreciated.


How can we ensure both diversity and quality?
---------------------------------------------

We need a "Beautiful Django Board" to ensure the diversity part and quality content (One of the hardest parts: how to judge a chapter quality).
I was first planning to ask for free contributions to write this book (as one of the aims is to give money to DSF) but I was making a strong and wrong assumption: people are ready to give some of their free time (and CAN) for that book. Writing a chapter, even a small one, represents a huge work. I'm sure some of you would be ready to do it in your spare time, but I don't want to lose any contributors because they can't afford the luxury to do so.
I'm still searching for ways to fund this book as I want every chapter/author to be paid. We shouldn't set apart contributors who can't help us for financial reasons. As we're all expecting a high-quality book, retributing authors is I think the way to go given that royalties would go to the DSF. Plus, divide it between authors/contributors wouldn't make much sense, none of us is going to get rich with that anyway.
So far, I'm considering a crowdsourced campaign and a few (few!) ad pages in the book so we can get companies on board with us. The dedicated amount (per chapter? per length?) for authors is not clearly defined yet. See "Publishing" section for more details about it.

A code of conduct and writing (certainly based on the Django one) will be used during the elaboration and the promotion of that book. Professionalism and respect are expected from all of us. The previous sentence is the only one not open for further discussion.

_I'm here asking for any help to set this CoC&W properly and make sure it's not just words blowing in the wind. Help needed._


Licensing
---------

So far, I'm considering CC-SA. We need to think about better reasons than just my personal feelings about it. Licensing is one key point and should be examined closely.
This section is clearly opened for further work because I lack more experience on that subject.


Publishing
----------

I first thought of O'Reilly to publish the book as O'Reilly distributes "Beautiful Code". It would ensure a certain sales amount and help with the promotion part.
The tradeoff is the cut they take. If we want to get any money to the DSF with that book, even if I know we're not talking about a high volume of green flying banknotes, we may do a better job publishing it on our own.
We need to crunch some numbers to assess which option is the best given our ambition and the reality of the reach we can have. (I need some help regarding the numbers here...)

If we set up a crowdsourced campaign and/or self-publish the book, we can imagine different packs with different pricing:
- web version only
- pdf + previous
- epub  + previous
- printed version + previous
We can also consider to set any of the first sections as free.
Any ideas is welcomed here as well. We may need to rethink the goal of that book: maybe the sharing part is way more important than giving DSF money given the amount we could get. 


Logo / Cover front page / Theme
-------------------------------

- Django, depending on the context, makes heavy use of a pink pony with magical power, snakes and guitars :snake: :guitar:.
We may try to make a benchmark of Django book covers: colors & style. I don't want our cover to be a pale copy of any other book but if some ideas are must-haves, we shouldn't avoid them.

Maybe you already have some beautiful things to show us that "Beautiful Django" inspires you. Your move folks!

Joachim Jablon provided a first quick proposal and without other submissions, this will serve as a baseline for now.


TODO (?)
--------

- We need to set up a "design" along with a "communication" section. In this first draft, it appears like it's of minor importance. I think this is a critical point and should draw more interest/attention.

- We should define how contributions would be assessed: how do we ensure diversity & quality (2 separate subjects).
It also means we need to work on the submission process: a chapter synopsis with a brief introduction? Submission by batch? Continuous?

- We need to work on the CoC&W: define a baseline and add particular points for this book.

- We need to assess how much a chapter would cost to a person writing it. We need to find an average and fair amount we can give to each author (but we might face credit limitations). I'm writing authors here but other contributors could be involved (e.g. a designer for a logo, front/back pages, etc.)
We should define this quickly, I don't want anyone to feel a particular aspect of contribution not acknowledged as it should.

- We need to define how the contributions should be made, so far I'm considering asciidoc and markdown (with a personal preference over the latter).


With much :heart:, Adrien Brunet.

*This draft has been elaborated from various discussions I had with Harry Percieval, Daniel GreenFeld, Audrey Roy, Baptiste Mispelon, Nicole and Olivier Harris, Adrienne Lowe. This draft only engages myself. Words are mine and I'm not speaking for them.

*A _huge_ thank you to Ana Balica for reviewing my spelling... (I'm feeling ashamed now! They were so many mistakes!)
