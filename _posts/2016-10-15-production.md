## Licensing

We are considering a [CC-SA license](http://beautifuldjango.com/LICENSE.txt) for this book. Licensing is one key point and should be examined closely. Please comment below or open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/beautifuldjango/beautifuldjango.github.io/issues 'issue tracker') to discuss this.


## Publishing

As [O'Reilly](http://oreilly.com/ 'oreilly') distributes "Beautiful Code", it would make sense to ask them to publish "Beautiful Django". Asking a large pusblisher to work with us would expose the book to a wide audience, but would mean that the royalties (and thus the funds for the DSF) would be limited. It would also be incompatible with a [crowdsourcing campaign](http://beautifuldjango.com/funding/2016/10/15/funding.html 'funding').

If our ambition is to donate a significant profit :money_with_wings: to the DSF, then self-publishing, or publishing with a small, independent publisher (who pays larger royalties) may be a better strategy.

We need to crunch some numbers to assess which option is the best. If you have a proposal that may be of interest to us, we'd love to hear from you!
