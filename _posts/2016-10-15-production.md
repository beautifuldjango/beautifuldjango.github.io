Licensing
---------

We are considering license [CC-SA](http://beautifuldjango.com/LICENSE.txt) for this book. Licensing is one key point and should be examined closely. Please comment below or open an issue on github to discuss this.


Publishing
----------

O'Reilly distributes "_Beautiful Code_", it would make sense to consider it to publish "_Beautiful Django_". It would ensure a certain sales amount and help with the promotion part. That said, the tradeoff is clear, the cut they take is quite enormous.

If we want to get any money to the DSF with that book, even if we are not talking about a high volume of green flying banknotes :money_with_wings:, we may do a better job publishing it on our own or via an other publisher with a smaller percentage.

We need to crunch some numbers to assess which option is the best given our ambition and the real reach we can have with this book. If you think you have some proposals which could be of interest for us, feel free to contact us.
