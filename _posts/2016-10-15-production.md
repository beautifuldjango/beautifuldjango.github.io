Licensing
---------

So far, I'm considering CC-SA. We need to think about better reasons than just my personal feelings about it. Licensing is one key point and should be examined closely.
This section is clearly opened for further work because I lack more experience on that subject.


Publishing
----------

I first thought of O'Reilly to publish the book as O'Reilly distributes "Beautiful Code". It would ensure a certain sales amount and help with the promotion part.
The tradeoff is the cut they take. If we want to get any money to the DSF with that book, even if I know we're not talking about a high volume of green flying banknotes, we may do a better job publishing it on our own.
We need to crunch some numbers to assess which option is the best given our ambition and the reality of the reach we can have. (I need some help regarding the numbers here...)

If we set up a crowdsourced campaign and/or self-publish the book, we can imagine different packs with different pricing:
- web version only
- pdf + previous
- epub  + previous
- printed version + previous
We can also consider to set any of the first sections as free.
Any ideas is welcomed here as well. We may need to rethink the goal of that book: maybe the sharing part is way more important than giving DSF money given the amount we could get.
