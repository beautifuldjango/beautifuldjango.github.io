Licensing
---------

So far, we are considering [CC-SA](http://beautifuldjango.com/LICENSE.txt). Licensing is one key point and should be examined closely. Please comment below or open an issue on github to discuss this.


Publishing
----------

O'Reilly distributes "Beautiful Code", it makes sens to have a look at it for 'Beautiful Django'. It would ensure a certain sales amount and help with the promotion part.
The tradeoff is the cut they take. If we want to get any money to the DSF with that book, even if we are not talking about a high volume of green flying banknotes :money_with_wings:, we may do a better job publishing it on our own.

We need to crunch some numbers to assess which option is the best given our ambition and the reality of the reach we can have.
