Who can contribute?
-------------------

Everyone! ["EVERYONE"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrTsuvykUZk "The Professional -- Everyone")!

But as stated in the diversity part, the idea would be to represent our entire world. We shouldn't publish this book unless every continent and a reasonable ratio of different people are represented. It is not a blog posts best-of exclusively written by scientific stars.
I'm also considering for now to offer anonymous contribution but I don't know if anyone would like to contribute without taking credits for it. Feedback people?

If you want to contribute, there is not only the writing part but also design, reviews, promotions etc... Any help, even the smallest comment on that manifesto draft is greatly appreciated.



TODO
----

- We need to set up a "design" along with a "communication" section. In this first draft, it appears like it's of minor importance. I think this is a critical point and should draw more interest/attention.

- We should define how contributions would be assessed: how do we ensure diversity & quality (2 separate subjects).
It also means we need to work on the submission process: a chapter synopsis with a brief introduction? Submission by batch? Continuous?

- We need to work on the CoC&W: define a baseline and add particular points for this book.

- We need to assess how much a chapter would cost to a person writing it. We need to find an average and fair amount we can give to each author (but we might face credit limitations). I'm writing authors here but other contributors could be involved (e.g. a designer for a logo, front/back pages, etc.)
We should define this quickly, I don't want anyone to feel a particular aspect of contribution not acknowledged as it should.

- We need to define how the contributions should be made, so far I'm considering asciidoc and markdown (with a personal preference over the latter).
