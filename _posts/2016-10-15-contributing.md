# Who can contribute?

Everyone! ["EVERYONE"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrTsuvykUZk "The Professional -- Everyone")!

Currently, we need help with:

- Writing the chapters
- Editing/correcting/reviewing the chapters
- Working on the design/illustrations
- Developing with the [fundraising](http://beautifuldjango.com/funding/2016/10/15/funding.html) campaign
- Searching for and engaging with authors worldwide
- Providing administrative support
- Developing a marketing and sales strategy, see [Production](http://beautifuldjango.com/manifesto/2016/10/15/production.html)
- Maintaining/developing the Beautiful Django Website (at least a new theme for this blog)
- Liasing with the DSF

This means we need contributors with a broad range of skills and experiences. Ideally, we would like to see contributions from the entire Django community in line with our [diversity goals](http://beautifuldjango.com/diversity/2016/10/15/diversity.html).

Any help, even the smallest comment on the blog posts, is greatly appreciated.

Note that all contributors are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct]().

# Specific tasks

If you want to help, the following tasks are the most important for moving the project forward:

- Define how contributions would be assessed: how do we ensure diversity & quality (2 separate subjects).
- Work on the submission process: a chapter synopsis with a brief introduction? Submission by batch? Continuous?
- Finish/improve Code of Conduct
- Establish/adopt a style guideline
- Develop a methodology for assessing how much a chapter would cost to write. We need to find an average and fair amount we can give to each author (but we might face budget limitations).
- Develop a methodolgy for assessing other contributions, e.g. design
- Establish the technical stack (we are currently considering asciidoc and markdown)
