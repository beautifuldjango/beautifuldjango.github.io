# Diversity

Efforts made by the Django community for greater diversity are remarkable. This book is going to follow the same standards.

As such, special attention will be given to ensure everybody will feel welcome, regardless of their origins, gender, countries and everything that makes you a unique person.

We hope we can work together with every dedicated community (e.g. Djangogirls) to make that happen.


# Code of Conduct

As a first step, we set up our code of conduct based on [contributor-convenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/). Further work on this may be needed.
