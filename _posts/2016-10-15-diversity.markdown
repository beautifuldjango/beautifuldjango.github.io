Diversity
---------

I think what impresses me most in our community are the efforts made to promote and respect diversity.
As such, special attention will be given to ensure diversity in gender, countries represented, authors' backgrounds and fields of application.
I hope we can represent all minorities within this book, there is no reason we couldn't.
I hope we can work together with every dedicated community (e.g. Djangogirls) to make that happen.
