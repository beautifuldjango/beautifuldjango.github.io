# Diversity

Efforts made by the Django community to promote diversity are remarkable. This book attempts to follow the same standards.

As such, special attention will be given to ensure everybody involved with the project will feel welcome, regardless of their origin, gender, country and anything else that makes them unique.

We hope we can work alongside special interest groups (e.g. Djangogirls) to make that happen.

# Code of Conduct

As a first step, we have adopted the [contributor-covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/) as [our code of conduct](http://beautifuldjango.com/code/of/conduct/2015/12/31/CoC.html).

All contributors are expected to follow our [code of conduct](http://beautifuldjango.com/code/of/conduct/2015/12/31/CoC.html).
