Beautiful Django Book Website

TODO list (short term)

* Add disqus comment
* Add analytics on the page
* Update to a more fancy jekyll theme
* Use same logo for organization, website etc. Maybe the "logo" should just be "beautiful django" written in a fancy cursive typo. (quick & dirty solution)
* Add small script to add automagically contributors to a contributor file

All contributions are welcomed.
