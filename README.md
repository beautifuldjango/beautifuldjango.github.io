The Book Website

TODO list (short term)

- [ ] Add disqus comment (pending)
- [x] Add analytics on the page
- [ ] Update to a more fancy jekyll theme
- [x] Use same logo for organization, website etc. Maybe the "logo" should just be "beautiful django" written in a fancy cursive typo. (quick & dirty solution)
- [ ] Add [small script](https://github.com/jlevy/ghizmo) to add automagically contributors to a new AUTHORS.md file


All contributions are welcomed.
